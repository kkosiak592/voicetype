# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Voice dictation must feel instant — sub-500ms from end-of-speech to text appearing at the cursor, with zero internet dependency.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (complete)
Status: Phase 1 complete — all 13 verification checks passed, ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — Completed 01-03 Task 2 (human-verify checkpoint approved)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 14%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: whisper.cpp over faster-whisper — CUDA 11.7 compatibility (faster-whisper requires CUDA 12)
- [Init]: Clipboard paste as primary injection — 50-100ms delays must be built in from day one, not retrofitted
- [Init]: Win32 WS_EX_NOACTIVATE required for overlay — Tauri config `focus: false` is insufficient on Windows (issue #11566)
- [Init]: CUDA build must set CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=61 explicitly — silent CPU fallback is a known failure mode
- [Phase 01-foundation]: show_menu_on_left_click(false) replaces deprecated menu_on_left_click in Tauri 2.10.x tray API
- [Phase 01-foundation]: use tauri::Manager must be explicitly imported to call get_webview_window on AppHandle — not re-exported from tauri prelude
- [Phase 01-foundation]: App identifier must not end in .app — use com.voicetype.desktop to avoid macOS bundle extension conflict
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-02]: Global-shortcut plugin must be registered in setup() via app.handle().plugin() with #[cfg(desktop)], not in builder chain — CLI auto-inserts incorrectly
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-02]: use tauri::Emitter required in shortcut handler closures — applies everywhere app.emit() is called
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-02]: desktop.json capability windows list must match actual window labels — CLI generates "main" but this app only has "settings"
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-03]: read_saved_hotkey() uses std::fs + serde_json directly — tauri-plugin-store Rust API requires async, not usable in synchronous setup()
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-03]: Tailwind v4 dark mode uses @variant dark in CSS — no tailwind.config.js, @variant replaces darkMode: 'class' config key
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-03]: e.code used for hotkey normalization in HotkeyCapture — layout-independent, maps directly to tauri shortcut format

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 6]: Win32 WS_EX_NOACTIVATE exact Rust API call needs to be identified from Tauri source or reference projects (Keyless, Voquill) — config alone confirmed broken
- [Pre-Phase 6]: silero-vad-rust crate version unverified — confirm on crates.io before writing Cargo.toml for Phase 5
- [Pre-Phase 7]: Code signing certificate (OV vs EV) decision and cost unresolved — budget needed before Phase 7 planning

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-27
Stopped at: Phase 1 fully complete — all 3 plans done, all 13 human-verify checks passed
Resume signal: Begin Phase 2 (02-audio-whisper)
