# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Voice dictation must feel instant — sub-500ms from end-of-speech to text appearing at the cursor, with zero internet dependency.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Audio + Whisper

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 7 (Audio + Whisper)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase (Task 1 complete, blocked at human-verify checkpoint)
Status: Phase 2 Plan 2 — whisper-rs CUDA module written, blocked on CUDA Toolkit install for build verification
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — Completed 02-02 Task 1 (code written, blocked on env setup for Task 1 verify + Task 2)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 14%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: whisper.cpp over faster-whisper — CUDA 11.7 compatibility (faster-whisper requires CUDA 12)
- [Init]: Clipboard paste as primary injection — 50-100ms delays must be built in from day one, not retrofitted
- [Init]: Win32 WS_EX_NOACTIVATE required for overlay — Tauri config `focus: false` is insufficient on Windows (issue #11566)
- [Init]: CUDA build must set CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=61 explicitly — silent CPU fallback is a known failure mode
- [Phase 01-foundation]: show_menu_on_left_click(false) replaces deprecated menu_on_left_click in Tauri 2.10.x tray API
- [Phase 01-foundation]: use tauri::Manager must be explicitly imported to call get_webview_window on AppHandle — not re-exported from tauri prelude
- [Phase 01-foundation]: App identifier must not end in .app — use com.voicetype.desktop to avoid macOS bundle extension conflict
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-02]: Global-shortcut plugin must be registered in setup() via app.handle().plugin() with #[cfg(desktop)], not in builder chain — CLI auto-inserts incorrectly
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-02]: use tauri::Emitter required in shortcut handler closures — applies everywhere app.emit() is called
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-02]: desktop.json capability windows list must match actual window labels — CLI generates "main" but this app only has "settings"
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-03]: read_saved_hotkey() uses std::fs + serde_json directly — tauri-plugin-store Rust API requires async, not usable in synchronous setup()
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-03]: Tailwind v4 dark mode uses @variant dark in CSS — no tailwind.config.js, @variant replaces darkMode: 'class' config key
- [Phase 01-foundation 01-03]: e.code used for hotkey normalization in HotkeyCapture — layout-independent, maps directly to tauri shortcut format
- [Phase 02-audio-whisper 02-02]: whisper-rs cuda feature requires CUDA_PATH env var at build time — CUDA Toolkit must be installed (not just drivers)
- [Phase 02-audio-whisper 02-02]: WhisperState uses Option<Arc<WhisperContext>> so app starts without model, logs warning with download instructions
- [Phase 02-audio-whisper 02-02]: CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=61 must be set before build for Pascal arch (P2000) — silent CPU fallback if omitted

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 6]: Win32 WS_EX_NOACTIVATE exact Rust API call needs to be identified from Tauri source or reference projects (Keyless, Voquill) — config alone confirmed broken
- [Pre-Phase 6]: silero-vad-rust crate version unverified — confirm on crates.io before writing Cargo.toml for Phase 5
- [Pre-Phase 7]: Code signing certificate (OV vs EV) decision and cost unresolved — budget needed before Phase 7 planning
- [Phase 02-02 ACTIVE]: CUDA Toolkit 11.7 not installed — must install before cargo build succeeds for whisper-rs cuda feature
- [Phase 02-02 ACTIVE]: LIBCLANG_PATH not set — must install LLVM/clang (VS "C++ Clang compiler" workload) for bindgen

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-27
Stopped at: Phase 2 Plan 02 — whisper-rs CUDA module committed (1e13ccd), awaiting CUDA environment setup and GPU verification
Resume signal: After CUDA Toolkit installed, LIBCLANG_PATH set, CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=61 set, and model downloaded — run `cargo build` then `cargo tauri dev` to verify GPU, then approve checkpoint
